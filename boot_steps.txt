Basic Steps for Bootloader

1.BIOS
    -Basic Input Output System
    -executes mbr (Master Boot Record)
    -searches, loads and executes bootloader program
    -looks for bootloader in floppy, cd-rom or hard drive
    -once bootloader is detected and loaded into memory, bios gives control to it

2.MBR
    -Mster Boot Record
    -located in first sector of bootable disc.typically /dev/hda or dev/sda
    -MBR is less than 512 mb
        -primary bootloader in first 446 bytes
        -partition table info in next 64 bytes
        -MBR validation in last two bytes
        -contains info about GRUB
    -in simple terms, loads GRUB
