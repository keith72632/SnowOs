x86 bootloader

Bios
    -BIOS is an x86 idiom for bootloader. First stage bootloader
    -BIOS selects boot device and copies first sector into physical memory at addr 0x7c00
    -boot sector(512mb) will conain bootloader code, partition table, disc signature
    as well as 'magic number'
        -'magic number is checked by bios to avoid loading something into boot sector
        that isnt suppose to be there
    -bios tells CPU to jump to beginning of bootloader, passing control to bootloader
    -in order for kernel to start:
        -load kernel from disc to memory
        -set tup global descriptor table
        -swtiching fro 16bit to 32 and passing control to kernel
Processor Modes
    -processor modes refer to way a processor creates an operating system env for itself
    -three mode: real mode, protected mode, virtual real mode
    -Real Mode
        -only one program at a time
        -faster but with limited memory(1mb)
        -doesnt use 32bit
    -Protected mode
        -used for multitasking
        -full access to systems memory
        -supports virtual memory
        -faster access to memory and faster 32bit drivers to do i/o
        -each program runnign has its own memory address
